### [Brian Hammons](https://github.com/bhammons)
![Brian Hammons](/images/bios/brian.jpg) The recent [**open sourcing of the Twelve-Factor App Methodology**](https://blog.heroku.com/heroku-open-sources-twelve-factor-app-definition) comes at a transformative moment for cloud-native platforms. As organizations increasingly rely on cloud-native technologies to power mission-critical workloads, the principles behind Twelve-Factor offer timeless foundations that remain relevant for modern platform builders. **[read on...](/blog/evolving-twelve-factor)**

## [Twelve-Factor App Methodology is now Open Source](/blog/open-source-announcement)
###### 12 Nov, 2024
### [Yehuda Katz](https://github.com/wycats)
![Yehuda Katz](/images/bios/yehuda.jpg) **Join us in modernizing the twelve-factor app manifesto together.** As a community of app, framework and platform developers, we’re working together to refresh this foundational document for the modern era. While it’s not software we’re working on, we’ll use familiar processes like pull requests, issues, and reviews to collaborate together in the [twelve-factor project repo](https://github.com/twelve-factor/twelve-factor).

This initiative builds on a strong foundation laid by Heroku when they originally created "The Twelve-Factor App" all the way back in 2011, a time when container-based deployment was still just emerging. Back then, developers could get apps running on their local machines, but common development mistakes often made it challenging to deploy those apps to production.  **[read on...](/blog/open-source-announcement)**

## [Narrow Conduits and the Application-Platform Interface](/blog/narrow-conduits)
###### 12 Nov, 2024
### [Vish Abrams](https://github.com/vishvananda)
![Vish Abrams](/images/bios/vish.jpg) Welcome to the twelve-factor maintainters blog. As stated in [our announcement](/blog/open-source-announcement), some of our posts will analyze the manifesto more generically. This is the first post in that vein,  where we dive into the interface between the application and the platform.

It is well understood that defining a clear contract between parts of a system allows one to shed cognitive load on either side of the contract. This has been called the "narrow-waist" principle which has some unfortunate connotations, so we'll refer to it as the "narrow-conduit" principle. This principle is especially valuable when the humans on either side of the conduit have dramatically different concerns.  **[read on...](/blog/narrow-conduits)**
